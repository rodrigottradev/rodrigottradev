- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Rodrigo. I am both Argentinian and Spanish guy. Currently, recently I worked in Mexico working as implementation manager (read my linkedin profile for more info!). Now I returned to Spain, looking for new adventures and a better quality life.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in software in general. Now, since I'm driving project implementations, my role is like more administrative, but I still love software development, above all backend development, and I never stopped learning using free resources on the internet
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Node.js, Java, and improving my soft skills every day thanks to my current job.
